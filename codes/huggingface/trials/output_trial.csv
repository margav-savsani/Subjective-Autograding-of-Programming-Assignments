"You have the task of grading a programming assignment submission. The problem statement and resources 
provided by the instructor will be given between [INSTRUCTOR] and [/INSTRUCTOR] tags. The rubric that is 
supposed to be graded will be given between [RUBRIC] and [/RUBRIC] tags. The student submission will be between
 [SUBMISSION] and [/SUBMISSION] tags. You are supposed to come up with a score for the submission for the given rubric. 
 I will give the instructor resources in second prompt then the rubric in the third prompt and the student submission in the fourth prompt. So in response to this first , second , third prompts just note the contents and output just the word NOTED and after the fourth prompt give only the score in between the tags [SCORE] and [/SCORE].", NOTED.

In this assignment, we will implement a dynamic queue in two different ways. 

The problem statement is given in queue.h    Please read the problem statement carefully.

The harness for testing your code is given in test.cpp 

You need to write your solution (programs) in two files linearQueue.cpp and circularQueue.cpp and compile by running ""make testLinear"" or ""make testCircular"" as appropriate.

Do not worry about running gnuplot to visualize the running times now. We will send you separate instructions about that.

[/RUBRIC]  [INST: Yes, the code is well structured and commented.]  [SCORE: 2]  [EXPLANATION: The code is well structured and commented, which makes it easy to understand and maintain. The code is organized into separate functions, and each function has a clear and descriptive name. The code also includes comments that explain what each function does and how it works. This makes it easy for others to understand the code and make changes or improvements if needed.]"

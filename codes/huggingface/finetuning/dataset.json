A queue stores an ordered sequence of elements, and allows\n// two operations: insert (at tail of queue) and delete (from head of queue).\n//\n// In this lab, we will implement a queue of a generic type using an array in two different ways.\n\n// In the first implementation, called linearQueue, consecutive elements in the queue are stored at\n// array locations with consecutive indices.  Thus, the first element in linearQueue must always be at\n// the array location with the smallest index (need not be 0) compared to other elements in linearQueue.\n// As an example, if linearQueue is implemented using an array A of size 10, and if there are 3\n// elements in the queue, the consecutive elements could be at locations A[3], A[4], A[5].\n\n// In the second implementation, called circularQueue, consecutive elements in the queue are stored at\n// array locations that are consecutive *modulo the array size*.  Thus, the first element in circularQueue\n// may not always be at the array location with the smallest index compared to other elements in\n// circularQueue.\n// As an example, if circularQueue is implemented using an array A of size 10, and if there are 3\n// elements in the queue, the consecutive elements could be at locations A[9], A[0], A[1].\n//\n// When the number of elements in the queue becomes larger than the array size, you have to grow the\n// array size linearly, i.e. by a fixed increment.  You must not grow the array size under any other\n// condition.  If needed, you can re-arrange the list elements in your array to ensure that you\n// don't grow the array size unless the queue contains more elements than the array size.  Note that this\n// will incur additional time/space overhead.  So think carefully about how you would like to implement this.\n//\n// Finally, we will compare the overall run-time for both the above implementations for a series of\n// inserts and deletes from the implemented queues.\n//\n// Comparison graph: x-axis is number of operations (insert/delete), y-axis run-time;\n// Expect to see different graphs depending on the sequence of inserts and deletes.\n//\n// Make sure to document your code properly using suitable comments\n//\n// This file contains the declaration of a template class DynamicQueue.\n// You are required to provide implementations of the member functions for linearQueue and circularQueue in\n// separate files named linearQueue.cpp and circularQueue.cpp.  \n//\n// Your code must compile using the provided make file.

A queue stores an ordered sequence of elements, and allows\n// two operations: insert (at tail of queue) and delete (from head of queue).\n//\n// In this lab, we will implement a queue of a generic type using an array in two different ways.\n\n// In the first implementation, called linearQueue, consecutive elements in the queue are stored at\n// array locations with consecutive indices.  Thus, the first element in linearQueue must always be at\n// the array location with the smallest index (need not be 0) compared to other elements in linearQueue.\n// As an example, if linearQueue is implemented using an array A of size 10, and if there are 3\n// elements in the queue, the consecutive elements could be at locations A[3], A[4], A[5].\n\n// In the second implementation, called circularQueue, consecutive elements in the queue are stored at\n// array locations that are consecutive *modulo the array size*.  Thus, the first element in circularQueue\n// may not always be at the array location with the smallest index compared to other elements in\n// circularQueue.\n// As an example, if circularQueue is implemented using an array A of size 10, and if there are 3\n// elements in the queue, the consecutive elements could be at locations A[9], A[0], A[1].\n//\n// When the number of elements in the queue becomes larger than the array size, you have to grow the\n// array size linearly, i.e. by a fixed increment.  You must not grow the array size under any other\n// condition.  If needed, you can re-arrange the list elements in your array to ensure that you\n// don't grow the array size unless the queue contains more elements than the array size.  Note that this\n// will incur additional time/space overhead.  So think carefully about how you would like to implement this.\n//\n// Finally, we will compare the overall run-time for both the above implementations for a series of\n// inserts and deletes from the implemented queues.\n//\n// Comparison graph: x-axis is number of operations (insert/delete), y-axis run-time;\n// Expect to see different graphs depending on the sequence of inserts and deletes.\n//\n// Make sure to document your code properly using suitable comments\n//\n// This file contains the declaration of a template class DynamicQueue.\n// You are required to provide implementations of the member functions for linearQueue and circularQueue in\n// separate files named linearQueue.cpp and circularQueue.cpp.  \n//\n// Your code must compile using the provided make file.  We may change the way the function main in test.cpp\n// inserts and deletes elements. test.cpp is provided to help you run your tests.  \n//\n//\n// FILES\n// DO NOT MODIFY this file, submit as-is\n// Write the CPP code for the member functions for the two implementations in files\n// LinearQueue.cpp and CircularQueue.cpp\n// Your code will be evaluated by compiling and running test.c, where we may change the way inserts\n// and deletes are done.\n\n// While testing, you can change the constant values given below if you want\n\n#define CONST_GROWTH 1000\n#define INIT_SIZE 1000\n\ntemplate <typename T> class DynamicQueue {\nprivate:\n  T *A;

Thus, the first element in circularQueue\n// may not always be at the array location with the smallest index compared to other elements in\n// circularQueue.\n// As an example, if circularQueue is implemented using an array A of size 10, and if there are 3\n// elements in the queue, the consecutive elements could be at locations A[9], A[0], A[1].\n//\n// When the number of elements in the queue becomes larger than the array size, you have to grow the\n// array size linearly, i.e. by a fixed increment.

A queue stores an ordered sequence of elements, and allows\n// two operations: insert (at tail of queue) and delete (from head of queue).\n//\n// In this lab, we will implement a queue of a generic type using an array in two different ways.\n\n// In the first implementation, called linearQueue, consecutive elements in the queue are stored at\n// array locations with consecutive indices.  Thus, the first element in linearQueue must always be at\n// the array location with the smallest index (need not be 0) compared to other elements in linearQueue.\n// As an example, if linearQueue is implemented using an array A of size 10, and if there are 3\n// elements in the queue, the consecutive elements could be at locations A[3], A[4], A[5].\n\n// In the second implementation, called circularQueue, consecutive elements in the queue are stored at\n// array locations that are consecutive *modulo the array size*.  Thus, the first element in circularQueue\n// may not always be at the array location with the smallest index compared to other elements in\n// circularQueue.\n// As an example, if circularQueue is implemented using an array A of size 10, and if there are 3\n// elements in the queue, the consecutive elements could be at locations A[9], A[0], A[1].\n//\n// When the number of elements in the queue becomes larger than the array size, you have to grow the\n// array size linearly, i.e. by a fixed increment.  You must not grow the array size under any other\n// condition.  If needed, you can re-arrange the list elements in your array to ensure that you\n// don't grow the array size unless the queue contains more elements than the array size.  Note that this\n// will incur additional time/space overhead.  So think carefully about how you would like to implement this.\n//\n// Finally, we will compare the overall run-time for both the above implementations for a series of\n// inserts and deletes from the implemented queues.\n//\n// Comparison graph: x-axis is number of operations (insert/delete), y-axis run-time;\n// Expect to see different graphs depending on the sequence of inserts and deletes.\n//\n// Make sure to document your code properly using suitable comments\n//\n// This file contains the declaration of a template class DynamicQueue.\n// You are required to provide implementations of the member functions for linearQueue and circularQueue in\n// separate files named linearQueue.cpp and circularQueue.cpp.  \n//\n// Your code must compile using the provided make file.  We may change the way the function main in test.cpp\n// inserts and deletes elements. test.cpp is provided to help you run your tests.  \n//\n//\n// FILES\n// DO NOT MODIFY this file, submit as-is\n// Write the CPP code for the member functions for the two implementations in files\n// LinearQueue.cpp and CircularQueue.cpp\n// Your code will be evaluated by compiling and running test.c, where we may change the way inserts\n// and deletes are done.\n\n// While testing, you can change the constant values given below if you want\n\n#define CONST_GROWTH 1000\n#define INIT_SIZE 1000\n\ntemplate <typename T> class DynamicQueue {\nprivate:\n  T *A;

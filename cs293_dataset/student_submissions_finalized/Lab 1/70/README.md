Basic info:
    -This file contains the implementations of linear queue and circular queue with the linearQueue.cpp and circularQueue.cpp containing the member functions of the Dynamic queue object/class created in queue.h.
    -There is a test.cpp which includes both queue.h and linear/circularQueue.cpp and can be used to test the implemented queues.
    -Makefile compiles test.cpp into both linearQueue and circularQueue executables but only one of them is a proper implementation at one time depending upon which one of the two implementations has been included in the test.cpp.
    -The workings of both the implementations have been explained in the comments of the respective cpp files.
    -These implementations also give us a fair idea of why circularQueue is more efficient than linearQueue in terms of both time and space.

Running instructions:
    For linearQueue: make sure to include linearQueue.cpp and comment out circularQueue.cpp in test.cpp and use the makefile to compile a testLinear executable.
    For circularQueue: make sure to include circularQueue.cpp and comment out linearQueue.cpp in test.cpp and use the makefile to compile a testcircular executable.

Thank You!

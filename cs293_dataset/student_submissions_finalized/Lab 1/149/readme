-test.cpp
    The values of num_ins and num_del are initialised to zero.
    #include"circularQueue.cpp" is included for checking circular queue.
The linear Queue and circular Queue is implemented as mentioned in the problem statement.
Linear queue functions a bit slower than Circular queue as linear queue needs to be shifted more number of times.

linearQueue.cpp
The queue is implemented normally. When the tail reaches N and head is not at zero, the whole queue is shifted such that head becomes zero to accomodate more elements. When it becomes really full it is incremented by a constant amount.

circularQueue.cpp
The queue is implemented such that tail can jump from N to 0 if it is empty. The queue goes through a full circle while filling. Its size is increased only when head and tail are next to each other and all the other places are filled.

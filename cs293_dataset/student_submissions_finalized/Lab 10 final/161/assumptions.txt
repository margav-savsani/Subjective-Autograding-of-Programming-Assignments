Assumed that the train info per station is specific to the station from which the train departured means for any station A the trains list we get from its tostations( current station B ) list corresponds to the trains which departured from station A to the station B.
assumptions about transit time -- for any train going from source to station A, i am only taking the first possible valid combination of days and arrival and departure time of the train, the days starting from sunday, from next station onwards time arrival and departure time and day is valid and first possible combination.
I am only cosidering the train journey possible from sun to sat, i.e., if train t departs from station A for station B on sat and arrival time of train t at station B is less than the departure time of train t from station A, then it won't show this journey as one possibility. This thing I have to improve.
Also I assumed that the arrival time shown at station A is actually the arrival time of train at station B.

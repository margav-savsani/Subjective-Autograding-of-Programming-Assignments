I have taken departure time  > arrival time for every train at every station.

for checking trasist times I considered the cases only if changing the trains occurs at the same day.

I have considered cases where transist time is < 24 hrs while solving.

if train reches a particular station today then it must leave this station today only or 
the given station must be the final station of that train.

I have not considered the cases where train travels only on particular days
so I haven't printed the days.

I have used a cout statement "you have to change the train now at :   " untill that 
statement is printed we are not changing trains.

I have printed every station and train which we have to take at that station for that journey.

I have ignored days of trains on which it runs.

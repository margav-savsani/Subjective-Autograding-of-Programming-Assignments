Assumptions:

* The train visits a station only once (there are no loops)
* The maxTransitTime is on a per transit basis
* Any type of transits are possible. But once the person reaches the destination he must stop there.
* Since there might be different journeys on different days (due to the fact that the train may not be a daily), I have put option to
choose an option for the first day (all can also be chosen - will give all possibilities)

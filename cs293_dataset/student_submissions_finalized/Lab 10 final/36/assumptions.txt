i didnt implement a new print function, i used the one given in planner
	so what i print is the total path of that journey 
	even if we dont change train same journey code will be printed but with different arr and dep times
	that is the info per station so the arr and dep times are different
	
	the print in planner prints the journey in a reverse order (srcstn at bottom)
	
i implemented maxstopovers only
did not implement transit time.

i assumed no circular journeys in the admin inputs

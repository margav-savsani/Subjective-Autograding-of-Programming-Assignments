Since there was not a clear way recommended to deal with differing days of travel, I took a very simplistic
approach when it came to the comparison with maxTransitTime. Similarly, since there was not much said about
dealing with computation with times of arrival/departure of trains with respect to the  units used, I basically
just implemented a dummy model for comparison, which can be made more sophisiticated as needed.
Using printStationInfo was perhaps not the ideal way to display information to the user, but as it was recommended,
I did use it.

1) along a journey, a train never travels between two consecutive stops for 24 hours or more at a stretch
2) The stopping time for a train at a station (where the train arrives at the station, stops for some time, and then leaves the station) is assumed to be less than 24 hours
3) The time spent on same train at a station is not considered in transit time.
4) If person arrives at station at some day on train A but does not continue on that train and in next days takes same train to go to next station then transit time is taken into consideration.

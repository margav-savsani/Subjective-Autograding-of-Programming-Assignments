-> the journies have different journy codes,
-> the train reaching adjacent station takes same time in any day
-> the implementation works for circular week(or something which means that)
-> two trains have differnt jcodes
->jcodes cant be negative
-> arr and dept days are same for any train in any station
-> ...


-> The code is incomplete, if given time, This could be much better, but owing to
  timme constraints this is what i was able to do.
-> the print function is not working right, but the final stations for any inputs are correct,
this can be check by commenting out print function in main function

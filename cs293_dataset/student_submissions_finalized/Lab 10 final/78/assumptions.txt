Assumptions-

A new class Journey has been declared in the printJourney.cpp file . It stores all the journey info including the train changes in between and the total transit time.
I have modified planner.h and planner.cpp for printing this new Journey class.

Following changes have been made- 

1] planner.h -->
void printJourneyInfo(listOfObjects<Journey *> *JourneyInfoList);

2] planner.cpp -->
void Planner::printJourneyInfo(listOfObjects<Journey *> *jlist){
  listOfObjects<Journey *> *currList, *expandedList;
  Journey *currInfo;
  currList = jlist;
  expandedList = nullptr;
  int listLength = 0;
  while (currList != nullptr) {
    currInfo = currList->object;
    if (currInfo != nullptr){
	  cout<<"Journey : \n";
      printStationInfo(currInfo->alljrnys);
	  cout<< GREEN <<"Transit Time : "<< currInfo->transittime << RESET <<endl;
    }
  	currList = currList->next;
  }
}

These changes have been done to use the printStationInfo function defined for the printing station information to print the journeys

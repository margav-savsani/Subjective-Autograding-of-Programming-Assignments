Assumptions :-

     # First my idea was to use recursion by taking base cases as maxStopOvers and maxTransitTime as zeroes .
     # If the maxStopOvers , maxtransitTime both are zero then the it should simply print the direct journeys from source station to destination station .
     # So I have used BFS for finding it .
     # Then there was no progress in my lab .
     # So I started searching for new idea .
     # Second I thought of  defining new class in printJourney.cpp .
     # So I have defined new class TrainInfoperStation which is similar to the class TrainInfoPerStation .
     # Then I have defined some member functions inside it .
     # But I didnt get any idea how to use them .
     # Lastly I thought of drawing the whole planner as a graph by using journeys as edges .
     # But I was not able to complete it within the time .
     # So I have submitted the BFS code which prints only the direct journeys without any stopovers .

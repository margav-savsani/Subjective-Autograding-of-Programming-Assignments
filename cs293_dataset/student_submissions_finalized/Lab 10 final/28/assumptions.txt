I created a class Networkobj which is the most fundamental of all 
I used that in a class Node which represents a vertex/node of the graph on which journey information is stored.
I created three different functions which are:
            presentadd()->It returns the traininfoperstation pointer if the train is present in the given linked list.
            alternateBFS()->I implemented a modified form of BFS which is different from the standard BFS.
            printPlanJourneys()->For printing all the Journeys which are possible.

The following assumptions are made:
1. As we have been provided with only one boolean array, it is assumed that the train arrive and depart on the same day
2. The person can deboard and board on the same train or train with the same journeycode that travels on a diff day later for example if a person goes from A to B in jc 231 then B to C in jc 331 and can again reboard 231 for going from C to D
3. As only boolean arrays are stored, to compute the number of days taken by a train to go from one station to another, the lowest number of days/shifts in the boolean array which would lead to us getting the stored boolean array are considered

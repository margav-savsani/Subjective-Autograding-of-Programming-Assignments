                      Assumptions

In this lab i left transit constraint for 
time-being and solved the problem.

I created a function which asks for start
location and end location and tells us 
whether there is a direct train between
them. This is done using DFS algorithm.

After defining this function, i kept track 
of all stations in between the journey in 
a linked list and printed it using
printJourney function defined earlier.

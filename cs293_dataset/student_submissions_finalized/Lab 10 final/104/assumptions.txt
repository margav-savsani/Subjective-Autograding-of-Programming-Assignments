## INPUT TRANSIT TIME IN GIVEN FORMAT
    An Integer whose units and tens digit denote minutes
    While rest of the digits denote hours

    For example if we want to input 14 hours and 37 mins 
    we will write time as "1437"

## ASSUMPTIONS
    Maximum time a train can run without stopping at any station is at most 24 hours

    Week starts with monday while ends with sunday

    A person won't wait more than a week at a transit station

    I have also removed non-sensible journies like if train arrives every week on say mon and tues
    then I won't print a journey that arrives on monday and departs on tues even if that journey satisfies all the conditions given to us

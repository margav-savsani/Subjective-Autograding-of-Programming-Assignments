Here in this DFS, instead of checking whether a node is visited or not, We use a new variable which keeps count of number of times the node is visited if the count is 2, then the algorithm backtracks otherwise it agin continues as it is.

For the adjacency list we use an array of list of integers, every time the randomgenerator genrates a pair of numbers both of them are checked if they are repeated and then inserts into the list of the integrs.

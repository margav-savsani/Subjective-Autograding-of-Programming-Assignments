1) Used recursive implementation of modified DFS
2) Extra Conditions --
   a) If DFS path travels from node A to node B, then anytime in the future path, it shouldnt travel from B to A by DFS movement.
      (except by backtracking)
   b) After a DFS backtracks from Node C to Node D, it cannot travel immediately from D to C, but can travel afterwards.

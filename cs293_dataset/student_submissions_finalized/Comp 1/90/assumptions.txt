1) It doesn't make any sense to travel to the predecessor of a node fromt the node, although its in its adjacency list
2) Results depends on which node in the connected component was the modified DFS started from, and 
    in my code, i have assumed it to start with the lowest value
3) No two nodes have the same value
4) Input values are non negative
5) If the input number of nodes and edges are not possible, then we gracefully terminate the program with a message

Assumptions:

I used the following conditions for traversal in DFS as explained by sir in the help session
1) If we travel from A to B, we cannot go from B to A
2) No of nodes visited once and twice, might be different for the same graph depending on the starting node

If there are multiple cycles involving a common node, then I considered it to be a part of only one cycle(i.e avoided recounting)

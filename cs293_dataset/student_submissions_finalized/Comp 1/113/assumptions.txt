1. Implemented recursive definition of BST 
2. Implemented DLL(doubly linked list) class (and also DLLNode) to help the implementation 
3. If we backtracked from a node and still it's visited count is 1 then we can visit it again if we come back there
4. Used some helper functions which takes BST as parameter and one which doesn't
5. The order in which the things are printed is different from the one which is mentioned in the question. 
6. BSTs are printed first with the number of connected component and then the rest of the things.
7. Nodes are visited in the order same as they were inserted in the adjacent list.

I have implememted my code as such that if we are on node and visit its adjacent
node and then backtracks on that node again then I will again visit that adjacent node
and now as it is two time visited I will not further visit it.
For eg.
If I have the graph 1--2--3
and I start my DFS from node 1 then the traversal according to my code is
1-2-3-3-2 and the BST tree would be
            1
             \
              2
               \
                3
               / \
              2   3
as I have assumed that the equal node in a BST would always be inserted on the right.

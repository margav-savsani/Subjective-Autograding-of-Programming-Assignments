For no of cycles I calculating using recursive cycle() which will remove all the nodes which have
degree 1 and  call the recursive function again until the total sum of the adjacency list size of 
all the nodes present until now if before sum and after sum are same the end the recursive function.
the BST code is a slightly modified version from the lab3 solutions which are provided in the git the 
modified BST doesn't have journey code and it will only have price.

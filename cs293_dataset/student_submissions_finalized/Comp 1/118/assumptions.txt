I have made the following assumptions :-
1. If, during DFS, I have previously traversed from A to B where A and B are adjacent, then I won't traverse from B to A.
2. If I have, previously, backtracked from a node, then if I reach the node again, I won't traverse it even if it has been visited only once.

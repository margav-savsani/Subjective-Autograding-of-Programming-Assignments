I took BST part from the solutions that are given in moodle and done slight modifications.
I used adjaceny matrix instead of linked list.
my order of visiting adjacent vertices is from index of lowest value to highest value.
In printing of BST i am printing values present in Node not index of Node.
I have used recursive DFS without changing its signatures.
I haven't used any otherlibrary.
I implemented some varibles and 2 extra functions.

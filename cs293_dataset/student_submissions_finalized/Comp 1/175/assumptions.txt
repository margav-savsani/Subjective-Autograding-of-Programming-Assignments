I have used the recursive implementation of DFS for this lab. I am visiting a node only if the following three conditions are met:

    1) should not be visited more than two times
    2) should not be the parent of this node
    3) should not be a node from which we have already backtracked

The parent is decided when the first time we reach a node from another one. Due to point '3' above, the number of nodes visited once and visited twice will vary but its consistent with my 
algorithm.

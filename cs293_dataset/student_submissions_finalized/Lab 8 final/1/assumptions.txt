* Improved the print functionality to remove spurious lines.

* The heap gives reviews with ratings >= the user-provided threshold.

* Added 2 extra member variables to Heap.h to know the number of elements in the heap,
and the righmost node in the last level.

* Added a helper function in Heap.cpp to get to the parent of the righmost node in the last level,
given the number of elements in the heap.

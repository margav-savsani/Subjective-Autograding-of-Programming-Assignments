Assumptions :-
  # I have added extra member variable "height" of int type in the class TreeNode which is equal to the height of the node in a particular heap .
  # I have added some extra member functions in the class Heap :- 
           1) getheight() :
                 # returns the height of a particular node in a heap .
           2) Heapify_up()  
                 # heapifies the object values in the node from bottom to top .
           3) Heapify_down()  
                 # heapifies the object values in the node from top to bottom .
           4) swap() 
                 # exchanges the object values present in the two nodes .
           5) findlast_insert()
                 # this actually returns the pointer pointing the node where the new node has to be inserted .
                 # thought someidea in my mind but this didnt work...so i didnt use this function anywhere in the code .
  # I have added some extra member variables num_levels , free_index both of int type in the class Heap .
  # num_levels refers to the number of levels in the heap tree .
  # free_index refers to the index of the free node in the last row where the new node has to be added during insertion .
  # I have defined array named array in the code and converted this heap into a binary heap ( left means 0 and right means 1 ) .
  # Used this array to find the node where the new node has to be inserted and also to find the node where the last node has to be deleted .
  # Finally I have implemented the print function which was referred from printBST given in old labs .

An additional variable "size" is also being maintained for the heap. It just tells the number of elements currently present in the Heap.
"size" also determines where insertions occur; the binary representation of size indicates the path starting from the root to where a new node has to be inserted.
The leading digit of the binary form (always 1) signifies entry into the root, further 0's and 1's represent left and right children, respectively.

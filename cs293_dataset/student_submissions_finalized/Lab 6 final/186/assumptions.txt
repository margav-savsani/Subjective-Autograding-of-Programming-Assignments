Assumptions :
1. I assumed that we will insert the exact word given into the trie, that is,
   case sensitive. So, on completions, if a station is PUNE CANT and you give 
   prefix as pun , then it may not work correctly as Trie is case sensitive.
2. However, I have made KMP implementation as case insensitive (for BONUS MARKS) as
   Professor told in piazza to do this for Bonus.
3. I assumed that other functionalities like deleting from Dictionary, deleting review,
   showing Reviews from a keyword etc are implemented already in problem. 
   So, I did not change those.

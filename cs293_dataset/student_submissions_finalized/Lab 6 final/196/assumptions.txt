I have assumed that all the station names should be unique and no clash of journey codes also.
Also one line was missing from planner.cpp version provided to us which led to failure of code in certain test cases.
I have corrected it by adding
jCRMatrix[row][col]=nullptr;
at line number 1048 in method clearJCRMatrixEntry.

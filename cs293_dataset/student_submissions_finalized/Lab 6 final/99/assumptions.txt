ASSUMPTIONS

In addCompletions, if the node is not the end of the word, return true
(No new completions are added for this).

The station names are only made of alphabets (either upper or lowercase).

The words are stored in uppercase in the trie by default.
The entire station names are case-sensitive, ie,
Mumbai Central and MUMBAI CENTRAL will be stored in different places,
but in the trie both are stored only under words MUMBAI and CENTRAL.

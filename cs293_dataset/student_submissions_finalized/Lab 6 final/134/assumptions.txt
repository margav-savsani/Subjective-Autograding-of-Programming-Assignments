-->Trie.cpp :: addCompletions(...):
    * add completions adds the name of stations to the list immediatly.
    * it doesn't check for repeatitions.
    Eg: suppose there is a station name "CHAT COT". if called to print all completions,
        with prefix "C" it would print "CHAT COT" 2 times.
    reason for assumption: It is beacuse, adding that comparitions is demanding much
                        work from program, which is not a better deal to exchange for
                        that feature according to my opinion

--> Assuming all the inputs are intended to what they were supposed to do.
    Eg: journey code should be integer.
    (This assumption is just as a precaution).

The assumptions made are as follows:

    1) Only the first occurence of the pattern is reported in KMP.
    2) If no match is found, KMP returns -1.
    3) The functions "isPresentInCompletions" and "freeCompletionList" isn't used anywhere in my code.
    4) To pass pointers as reference in "addCompletions" and "recursiveAddCompletions", the declaration of these functions were changes slightly.

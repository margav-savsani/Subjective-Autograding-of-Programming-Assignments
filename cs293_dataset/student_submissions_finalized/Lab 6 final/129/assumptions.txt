I have assumed that if there are two words with same prefix in a string my completion function would print it twice ;
For eg if I want to find LOKMANYA TILAK TERMINUS MUMBAI and I write LOK T T , It would give me:
0 LOKMANYA TILAK TERMINUS MUMBAI
1 LOKMANYA TILAK TERMINUS MUMBAI
Both of them are the same stations , so to avoid this I checked it , but it wa incrementing my time-complexity so I commented that part out , it is there in 
addCompletions function, if you want to check you can uncomment that part out.

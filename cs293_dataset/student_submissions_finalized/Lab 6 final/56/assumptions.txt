1. If the string is an empty string, then my computeHMatrixForKMP returns a nullptr.
2. I assumed that one station name gets added only once to the indices array at the last node for each word in the Trie.
3. My Trie::insert returns false if the index is already present in the indices array of the node
4. My Trie::del returns false if
    a. The word to be deleted doesn't exist.
    b. The station name specified as the argument is not present in the names corresponding to the indices in the indices array of the last node of the word.
5. My Trie::completions returns a nullptr if the prefix is invalid
6. My Trie::addCompletions asserts that the TrieNode being passed as an argument is the last node of that word.

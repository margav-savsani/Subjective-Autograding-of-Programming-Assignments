1 - No cyclic loops are there in the graph of stations, don't know what would happen if they were 
    there but have not taken any measures against it.
2 - Indices of stations are unique. Equality of stnIndex implies same station in my code.
3 - Journey code same means same train travelling in the same direction. If another train is present 
    along the same path but different direction (say a train in return journey), it must have a 
    different journey code.
4 - Inputs of station names are there in the station names list and are valid.

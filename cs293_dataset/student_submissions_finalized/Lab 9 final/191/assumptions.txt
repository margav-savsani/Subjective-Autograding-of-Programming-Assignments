--- I have assumed that a train follows only a particular train sequence, i.e,
if A-B-C-D-E is a path then A-C-E or A-F-E etc can't be true for the current train.
They may have train with a different journeyCode surely

--- I have used printStationInfo to print trains and the trainInfoPerStation used is of that of the source station, so if a trian goes from A-B-C then direct journey A-C prints trains containing day, jrneyCode, arrival and departure time, etc at A

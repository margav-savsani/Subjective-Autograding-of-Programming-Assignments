I defined another funtion "BFS_tostorelinkedlists"
this keeps of all vertices with same level in a 
linkedlist and then stores each linkdlist in an array
which is defines as global variable so that we can 
add lists whenever we want and access through it easily.

In the main function i am just coming from destination
station now to get the path track and store all 
possible paths in different linkedlists and then using
"printStationInfo" on all the listto get the output.

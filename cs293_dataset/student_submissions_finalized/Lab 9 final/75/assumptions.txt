Assumptions:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. a train only traverses one path, i.e., if a train goes throught A-B-C-D-E then it can't go through A-C-E or A-F-D-E etc.
2. arrival times at any station > departure time if none of them are -1 - i.e. the train stops at all the stations it is visiting during its journey. If a train doesn't stop at a station in its journey, this won't be listed as a stop of the station and the graph of connections between stations won't have an edge to the station in question.
3. if there is a train from A to B with a journey code, there won't be a train from B to A with the same journey code. In other words, assume that we wont traverse a station with the same journey code twice.

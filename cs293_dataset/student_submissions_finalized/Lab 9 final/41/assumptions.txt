My assumptions:
1) I created two new class; BFS and Train.
2) BFS class have a linekd list implementation used for searching and Train class is for storing the data related to train.
3) Then I created two more functions; search_journey and train_add_journey.
4) search_journey searches the journey in the linked list and train_add_journey adds the data to th elinekd list.

*****************Interpretation of modified BFS*******************************************************
My implementation performs BFS, based on graphs, in which directed edges exist, only if the train with specific journey code connects the two stations
First I store all the trains leaving from source in a doubly linked list
Then ,for each of the trains, a BFS is performed. If destination is reached somewhere in between, we store that journey code

******************************Source=Destination*******************************************************
If source and destination are the same, I print out all the trains leaving from source station. Since 
a (retarded) person can obviously go sit in a train for 5 mins and leave it at the same station.

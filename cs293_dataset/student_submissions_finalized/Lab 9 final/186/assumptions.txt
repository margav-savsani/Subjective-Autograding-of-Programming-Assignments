Assumptions :
1. I assumed that no train with a unique journey code will form a loop, that is a condition in which a train with journey code
   'x' goes from A -> B -> C , the same train with journey code 'x' will not go from C -> D -> F -> A or C -> B -> A.
2. I assumed that all journey codes are unique. There are no two trains going and arriving different stations with same journey Code.
3. Since nothing was mentioned aboout arrival and departute time of trains, I printed all the direct trains from source to destination,
   with arrival and Departure timings being those at the destination.
   Actually, displaying both timings at source and destinations makes sense. So, I think it will not be an issue.
   For example, if a train starts at pune and ends at mumbai and source is pune and destination is mumbai. Then for the trains that I will
   get, I am displaying there arrival/Departure timings at mumbai (destination).

### CS293 LAB 7 ASSUMPTIONS :

- Sorting Order:
   I sorted the Train informations on the basis of a preference order -
   1. days of week 
   2. Arrival time
   3. Departure time
   That is, first basis for sorting is the day at which the train runs.
   If it is same for two trains, then their arrival time is considered.
   If it is also same, then there Departure time is considered.

- I did not created a function Planner::partition as in my implementaion, the
  partitioning is done inside the QuickSort function as well.

- I have implemented both QuickSort and QuickSortSimple functions. You can uncomment one of them
  in planner.cpp to test it.

- I created two Function (bool compare) and (void swapStnInfo) in quicksort.cpp to compare two objects and swap two Nodes.

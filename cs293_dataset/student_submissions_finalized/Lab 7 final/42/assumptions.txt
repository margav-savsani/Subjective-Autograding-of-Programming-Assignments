My assumptions were related to the sorting of the train station journeys. I stuck to a simple sorting procedure of sorting first with respect to the days, and then sorting with respect to the arrival times. If the arrival times were equal I said one was not less than each other, and y my quicksort, it meant that they're actually equal. The arrival trains with arrival times -1 were placed at the start of the sort, just because -1 was less than any other arrival time.

Assumptions made in Lab 7:

1. I have arranged the stations using arrTime and not depTime. It is mentioned in the piazza post:  https://piazza.com/class/l7f1yds2pb71c4/post/66

2. I have done the bonus part. Please check it by uncommenting the quicksort function in planner.cpp.

3. As far as the entries with arrTime = -1 are considered, I have put at the start of the given day. 
	
	For e.g. if I have entries 
		Mon, arrTime: -1
		Mon, arrTime: 1250
		Sun, arrTime: 1800
		
		
	They are arranged as:
		Sun, arrTime: 1800
		Mon, arrTime: -1
		Mon, arrTime: 1250
		
		
5. Please checkout the 'choosing pivot' part in partition function. It uses less than K steps in the for loop.

6. In " listOfObjects<TrainInfoPerStation *> **arr ", the array 'arr' is the array of those special points in the array which start from 0
	and go on at increments of K.
	
	For e.g. if n = 18 and K = 4
		Then the nodes at indices = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 are stored inside array 'arr'
		
	If I want to access say node at index = 13,
	I first go to node at index = 13 - floor(13 / 4 ) i.e. 12
	This I do using 'arr'.
	Then from node 12, I can go to node 13 in 1 step.
	I can go to 12, 13, 14, 15 in less than 4 steps.

if a train departure time is compared with any other train departing on same day at some other time then :
	since -1 will be less than that time so ..TRAIN NOT DEPARTING FROM STATION WILL BE PRINTED FIRST.
in case there are two trains that are not departing on the same day ie both have departure time -1:
	in that case ANY OF THE TWO TRAINS CAN BE PRINTED FIRST {because if both of the trains are not departing it does not make sense to decide which train will depart first}

The sorting of the trains is primarily based on the precedence of the day of the week they runs on,
if the days are equal, they are sorted based on their arrival times.

Equal arrival times have equal precedence.

If a train is starting at the station, i.e. arrival time -1
it comes first in the precedence order.

Assumptions:

1. The stations are compared as follows:
  a. The days (starting from Sunday) where first train arrives are checked.
  b. If those are same, then the departure times are compared (-1 is given higher priority, because it will mean train is not going to leave the station, hence has lesser priority than the train which is going to leave at some time)
  c. If both the departure times are same (non-negative or -1), then the arrival times are checked.

My assumptions are:
1) I made a function 'Quick' which is called recursively for sorting the elements
2) A function 'get_pivot' is made to get the pivot for sorting.
3) A function 'swap_train_data' is made for swapping two train info totally.
4) A function 'train_station_number' is used for returning list of train number
5) A function 'funciton' is used for sorting the same data of the same day.

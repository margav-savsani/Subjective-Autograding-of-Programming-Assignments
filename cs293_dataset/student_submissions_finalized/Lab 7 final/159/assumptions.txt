i have implememnted quicksortsimple.
my idea for random pivoting is for example take n=20,k=4.
created a static array of size n/k=5.
copied 0,4,8,12,16 positions of linked list in this array.
now let us say i want 19th position to be pivot then i will take 16th from
array and make 3 nexts.
so for any pivot firstly i will one random number from 0 to 4(n/k-1) that decides 
which array element i have to take and next random number from 0 to 3(k-1) that
decides how many times i should move next.

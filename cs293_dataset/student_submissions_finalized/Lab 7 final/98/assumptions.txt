I have sorted the trains first with respect to the days and then with 
respect to the arrival times.
2 trains arriving on the same day and same time can appear in any order, I am
not orderering the trains on the basis of departure time for such cases.
Also clarified by sir on piazza that trains can appear in any order in such
a case.

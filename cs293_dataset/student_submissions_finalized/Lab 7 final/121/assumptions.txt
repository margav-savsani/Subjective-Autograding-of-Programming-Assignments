Assumptions made for QuicksortSimple implementation :
    -stnInfoList is not nullptr
    -start and end are non negative integers
    -start and end are not out of bounds of stnInfoList, 
     that is both of them are from 0 to (length of linked list)-1.
    -rand() function generates uniform random integers and pivots
     generated using it are indeed random.
    -made some more functions along with QuicksortSimple for cleaner 
     implementation of function. Though, it is possible to do the same 
     without these functions, it just increases the readability : 
        myswap - swaps the TrainInfoPerStation* object inside 2 given links
        isgt - compares 2 TrainInfoPerStation* objects and returns if the first
               one is greater than the other. Comparison is done on the basis of 
               day of the week and then if day of the week is same then departure 
               time is considered.

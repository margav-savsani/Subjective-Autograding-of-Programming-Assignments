The stations have been sorted by the following rule:
-> First the days are compared, if a station has an earlier day, it appears first
-> If the days are same, then the departure times are compared, the train with earlier departure time appears first
-> Departure time -1 appears first

Only QuicksortSimple has been implemented.

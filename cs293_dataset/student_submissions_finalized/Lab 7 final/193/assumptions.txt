1) The comparison of two TrainInfo is done first on the basis of
   which train arrives earlier according to the days of the week.
   i.e Sun < Mon < Tue ...

2) If any two trains arrive on the same day then the comparison is made
   on the basis of which train departs earlier.
   i.e 
      DAY | ARR  | DEPT.
  (1) Sun | 1200 | 1600
  (2) Sun | 1300 | 1400

    In the above case the (2) < (1).

3) For the case when the arrival day and departure time is same for both the trains,
   There is no such order based on the arrival time and hence it can come in any order
   according to the order of input given.

4) I have implemented both the Quicksort functions.

5) The Quicksort function without start and end uses the static variables to track the
   start and end of the current linked list to be sorted.

6) The Normal Quicksort function takes in the starting pointer of the list and start and end
   indices to sort the linked list.

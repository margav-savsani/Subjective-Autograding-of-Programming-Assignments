1) attributes of class TrainInfoPerStation are public to be able to access it in quicksort.cpp.
2) need not add partition function in the Planner class if attributes said above are public. 
3) include quicksort.cpp wherever required (though should not be required).
4) use Quicksort(listOfObjects<TrainInfoPerStation *> *stnInfoList) to run the quicksort function.

Pivot:
1) for an N element long linked list, visualise N/K check points after every K elements.
2) now we are left with N/K lists with starting point as marker to the start of every linked list. 
3) randomly generated a number less than (N/K + 1). This will choose one of the N/K independent sub-linked list just generated. 
4) randomly generated a number less than (K + 1). This will tell how many times to traverse the chosen sub-linked list from the starting point of the linked list. This will ensure that worst case time complexity of choosing the pivot is O(K).

i have divide the linked list in n/K parts on the 0th recursion level and put the heads of each sublist
in a array called heads.
this array allows me to access any object in O(K) time: index = index/K + index%K
i can reach index/K in constant time thanks to heads arr and then index%K ahead in O(K) time.

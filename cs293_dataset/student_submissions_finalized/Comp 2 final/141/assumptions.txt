1. There are no cycles in the graph
2. Ordering of edges does not matter, neither does that of the vertices in the final output
3. If a symmetric, transitively closed component contains an edge from some node belonging to that componenet to some other node of that component, this does not result in a self-edge in the collapsed graph

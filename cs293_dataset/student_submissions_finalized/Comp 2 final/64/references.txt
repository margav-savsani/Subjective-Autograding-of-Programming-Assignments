For giving the input file as input please follow:
Run the following commands:
    g++ main.cpp
    ./a.out
Then it will ask for input: Please write the input file name
So the commands for input file name "inputs.txt" are
g++ main.cpp
./a.out
inputs.txt


I have printed the output in a terminal instead of in a file. Please consider it.

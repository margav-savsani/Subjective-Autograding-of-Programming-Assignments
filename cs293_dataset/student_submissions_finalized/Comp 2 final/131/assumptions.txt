*make sure any test case has less than 100 nodes or precisely less than 100 similar nodes else  change this value of 100 accordingly in graph.h constructor of class node 
*the same edges may be printed multiple times in the collapsed graph , ignore repition (else diffinately more space and time complexity can be increased but avoided at this step)

* to run:
 g++ -g -o executablefilename main.cpp
 ./executablefilename inputfilename
 These instructions were used all the labs so far , my version of vs code doesnt work with if I input data from a file using '<' symbol

I wanted to solve this by the following approach:
	(i) find all trains that pass from source station
	(ii) for each train, make a new graph from the same vertices (stations) with fresh edges (train that pass through consecutive stations)
	(iii) for each graph do BFS, and if the search hits the destination station print this journey


NOTE: This logic is wrong, as sir explained in piazza, so I left with incomplete solution to this lab

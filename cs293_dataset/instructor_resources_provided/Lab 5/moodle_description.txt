Please read the problem statement carefully, go through the provided boiler plate files and fill in your code.

To compile, simply run

g++ -g -o AVLBSTTest main.cpp

This will generate an executable called AVLBSTTest, which you can run as ./AVLBSTTest

Submission instructions:

1. Create a separate directory named <roll_number>_L5

2. Clearly write whatever assumptions you had to make in a file named assumptions.txt

3.Place only the following files in the above directory

BST.h, BST.cpp, AVL.h, AVL.cpp, Tree.h, main.cpp, assumptions.txt

Any other files found in this directory will lead to severe penalty

4. Go to the parent directory of <roll_number>_L5

5. Run tar -zcvf <roll_number>_L5.tgz <roll_number>_L5

6. Upload only the <roll_number>_L5.tgz file on Moodle

Any deviation from following these submission instructions will lead to your submission not being graded.

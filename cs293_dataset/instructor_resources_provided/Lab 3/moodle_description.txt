In this lab, we will have some fun with binary search trees and their traversal order.  You should already have learnt about these from your CS 213 lectures.

Please read the problem statement given in problem.pdf very carefully.

The assignment has 2 parts.  Part 1 is expected to be completed in the lab by 5pm on Aug 19, and TAs will come and do an initial evaluation of your work on this part.  Part 2 is expected to be submitted by Aug 26, 2pm.

Please download all files of the assignment provided below in your working directory.

Please read the comments in the provided files BST.h and BST.cpp very carefully.  You MUST NOT modify the parts of these files that you are asked not to modify.

For compilation, you should simply run "make interactive" or "make automated" and it should produce the corresponding executable called "interact" or "automated" respectively. 

We have already created test harnesses for you, so you can test your code (once it compiles correctly) by running "interact" or "automated" (for interactive and automated testing respectively). 

You must upload your solution to Part 1 as a zipped file named part1.zip and containing BST.h and BST.cpp by 5pm today (Aug 19). 

Your solution to Part 2 must be uploaded as a second zipped file named part2.zip (containing BST.h, BST.cpp and any other file you may want to create for solving part 2) by 2pm on Aug 26.

Please feel free to ask the instructor or TAs for any clarifications.

This assignment is about implementing tries and KMP algorithm.

Please read the problem statement carefully in problem_statement.pdf

You should be editing files Trie.h, Trie.cpp and KMP.cpp

To compile simply run g++ -g -o planner main.cpp

To run, simply run ./planner log_file_name

To help you debug, a log file gets generated that shows some detailed log messages.  Of course, this is not a substitute for gdb

You must upload only kmp.cpp, planner.cpp, planner.h, Trie.h, Trie.cpp in one .tgz flle named <roll_number>_L6.tgz

Please read the problem statement carefully, state all your assumptions in assumptions.txt and submit a tar zipped folder named <roll_number>_C1.tgz containing only the following files:

Graph.cpp, Graph.h and assumptions.txt

To compile your code, use g++ -g -o modDFS main.cpp

To run the compiled code, use ./modDFS  N M graphFileName, where N is the count of nodes, M is the count of edges (should be <= N(N-1)/2) and graphFileName is the name of a file in which your random graph will be written in the format

numNodes

numEdges

Edge1_node1  Edge1_node2

Edge2_node1  Edge2_node2

...

You can open the file named graphFileName after running your code to see what random graph was generated.

To debug your code, use gdb ./modDFS on Linux and lldb ./modDFS on Mac

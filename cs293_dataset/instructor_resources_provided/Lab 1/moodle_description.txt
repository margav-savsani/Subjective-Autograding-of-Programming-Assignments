In this assignment, we will implement a dynamic queue in two different ways. 

The problem statement is given in queue.h    Please read the problem statement carefully.

The harness for testing your code is given in test.cpp 

You need to write your solution (programs) in two files linearQueue.cpp and circularQueue.cpp and compile by running "make testLinear" or "make testCircular" as appropriate.

Do not worry about running gnuplot to visualize the running times now. We will send you separate instructions about that.

Please follow the submission instructions below carefully. 
Submissions prepared without following these instructions WILL NOT BE GRADED.

1. Create a separate directory named <roll_number>_L10, where roll_number is your roll number. 

2. Clearly write whatever assumptions you had to make to solve the lab assignment in an ASCII text file named assumptions.txt 
If you have not made any assumptions, create an empty assumptions.txt file

3. Place only the following files in the above directory (i.e. in <roll_number>_L10):  

          printJourney.cpp, assumptions.txt 
   
    Any other files found in this directory may lead to severe penalty

4. Go to the parent directory of <roll_number>_L10

5. Run tar -zcvf   <roll_number>_L10.tgz    <roll_number>_L10

6.  Check by running tar -xcvf <roll_number>_L10.tgz that the extracted directory contains only printJourney.cpp and assumptions.txt, and nothing else.  Make sure there are no hidden files in the extracted directory.

You can list all files in a directory, including hidden files, on Linux using "ls -a"

7. If the above step shows shows files other than printJourney.cpp and assumptions.txt in the extracted directory, delete the <roll_number>_L10 directory and re-start from step 1.

Otherwise, upload only <roll_number>_L10.tgz  on Moodle

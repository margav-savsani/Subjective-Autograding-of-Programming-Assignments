Please strictly follow the submission instructions below.

1.  Place the following files (containing your solution to lab assignment 4) in a folder named <roll_no>_L4, where <roll_no> is to be replaced by your roll number (e.g. if your roll number is 1234567890, the folder name should be 1234567890_L4):

sort.h, sort.cpp, tree.h, tree.cpp, makeTree.cpp, choose.h, choose.cpp, journey.h, journey.cpp

No other files or folders should be placed here.

2. Change your working directory to the parent of the <roll_no>_L4 folder.  Then run tar -zcvf <roll_no>_L4.tar.gz <roll_no>_L4 from the shell prompt.  Needless to say, you must replace <roll_no> in all of these with your roll number.

This will produce a file <roll_no>_L4.tar.gz

E.g. if your roll number is 1234567890, you should run

tar -zcvf 1234567890_L4.tar.gz 1234567890_L4

3. Upload <roll_no>_L4.tar.gz here. 

Only this file should be uploaded.
